# sign language detection using ml
Sign Language Detection for Recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) Using Machine Learning" bridges the communication gap between hearing and non-hearing individuals. This project uses computer vision and machine learning to identify ASL hand gestures and translate them into corresponding alphabets. By training on a dataset of ASL gestures, the model learns to recognize subtle differences in hand shapes, orientations, and movements.
